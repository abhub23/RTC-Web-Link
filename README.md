# Website README

## Project Overview

This project is a **real-time communication website** built with **React** and **TypeScript** as the frontend framework and language. The website leverages **WebSockets** for real-time, bi-directional communication between clients and the server. The goal of the website is to provide users with seamless real-time interactions, such as messaging, notifications, or live updates.

## Features

- **Real-time Communication**: Uses WebSockets to enable instant updates and live communication.
- **TypeScript Support**: Ensures strong typing and better code maintainability.
- **Modular React Components**: React is used for building reusable and maintainable UI components.
- **State Management**: (Add details about state management if you are using any libraries like Redux, Zustand, etc.)
- **Responsive Design**: The application is mobile-friendly and adjusts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: UI framework for building dynamic single-page applications.
- **TypeScript**: Provides static type checking for better code quality.
- **WebSockets**: Enables real-time communication between the client and server.
- **Node.js** (Backend - Optional): If you're using a Node.js server to handle WebSocket communication.
- **Express.js** (Backend - Optional): If you're using Express.js as the server framework.
- **CSS / SCSS**: For styling the UI.
- **ESLint / Prettier**: Linting and formatting tools for code quality.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (>= 14.x)
- **npm** (>= 6.x) or **yarn**
- **WebSocket Server**: Ensure the backend server supports WebSocket connections.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get the project running on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Use npm or yarn to install the required dependencies:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# Using yarn
yarn install
```

### 3. Running the Application

To start the React development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the React app in development mode. Open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

The application will automatically reload if you make any changes to the code.

### 4. WebSocket Server

Make sure your WebSocket server is running and accessible. If the server is not running locally, update the WebSocket URL in the codebase to point to the correct endpoint.

If you're using **Node.js** as the backend for WebSocket handling, start the backend server:

```bash
node server.js
```

### 5. Building for Production

To create an optimized production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will bundle the React app and create a `build/` directory containing the static files to be deployed.

### 6. Linting & Formatting

To run lint checks and format your code:

```bash
# Lint the code
npm run lint

# Format the code
npm run format
```

## Configuration

### WebSocket Configuration

In your code, WebSocket connections will be initialized with something like:

```typescript
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080'); // Update this URL accordingly
```

Make sure to update the WebSocket URL to match your backend server.

### Environment Variables

If you're using environment variables, create a `.env` file in the root of the project to store API keys or URLs. Example:

```
REACT_APP_WEBSOCKET_URL=ws://localhost:8080
```

Use `process.env.REACT_APP_WEBSOCKET_URL` in your code to access environment variables.

## Project Structure

Below is a simplified structure of the project:

```
/src
  /components      # React components
  /services        # WebSocket or API service functions

  /styles          # CSS/SCSS files
  /utils           # Utility functions
  App.tsx          # Main application component
  index.tsx        # Entry point of the React app
  ...
```
